# The list of experimental Kotlin stdlib annotations.
# Declarations from kotlin stdlib marked with those annotations cannot be used in the projects
# that are published for the IJ Kotlin plugin to avoid stdlib binary compatibility problems.
# See KT-62510 for details.
# The list should be updated as new experimental annotations are added or removed from the stdlib.
